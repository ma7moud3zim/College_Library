# E-BookStoreProject

A simple library manager project with a gui that control a database system of Books and its authors.

You can add, delete or update the books in the database. Also you can search about the book you need by the ISBN of that book.

The project apply UI design and some OOP characteristics.

I added a good looking hover to the menu buttons.
